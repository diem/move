# memory-level

**In-memory [`abstract-level`][abstract-level] database for Node.js and browsers, backed by a [fully persistent red-black tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/functional-red-black-tree).** The successor to [`memdown`](https://github.com/Level/memdown) and [`level-mem`](https://github.com/Level/mem).

## Usage

_If you are upgrading: please see [`UPGRADING.md`](./UPGRADING.md)._

```js
const { MemoryLevel } = require('memory-level')

// Create a database
const db = new MemoryLevel({ valueEncoding: 'json' })

// Add an entry with key 'a' and value 1
await db.put('a', 1)

// Add multiple entries
await db.batch([{ type: 'put', key: 'b', value: 2 }])

// Get value of key 'a': 1
const value = await db.get('a')

// Iterate entries with keys that are greater than 'a'
for await (const [key, value] of db.iterator({ gt: 'a' })) {
  console.log(value) // 2
}
```

With callbacks:

```js
db.put('example', { hello: 'world' }, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err

  db.get('example', (err, value) => {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(value) // { hello: 'world' }
  })
})
```

## API

The API of `memory-level` follows that of [`abstract-level`](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level) with a one additional constructor option (see below). The `createIfMissing` and `errorIfExists` options of `abstract-level` are not relevant here. Data is discarded when the last reference to the database is released (i.e. `db = null`). Closing or reopening the database has no effect on the data. Data is _not_ copied: when storing a Buffer value for example, subsequent mutations to that Buffer will affect the stored data too.

### `db = new MemoryLevel([options])`

Besides `abstract-level` options, the optional `options` object may contain:

- `storeEncoding` (string): one of `'buffer'`, `'view'`, `'utf8'`. How to store data internally. This affects which data types can be stored non-destructively. The default is `'buffer'` (that means Buffer) which is non-destructive. In browsers it may be preferable to use `'view'` (Uint8Array) to be able to exclude the [`buffer`](https://github.com/feross/buffer) shim. Or if there's no need to store binary data, then `'utf8'` (String). Regardless of the `storeEncoding`, `memory-level` supports input that is of any of the aforementioned types, but internally converts it to one type in order to provide a consistent sort order.
