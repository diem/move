| TypeScript implementation of the Ethereum StateManager. |
| ------------------------------------------------------- |

## Installation

To obtain the latest version, simply require the project using `npm`:

```shell
npm install @ethereumjs/statemanager
```

Note: this library was part of the [@ethereumjs/vm](../vm/) package up till VM `v5`.

## Usage

### Introduction

The `StateManager` provides high-level access and manipulation methods to and for the Ethereum state, thinking in terms of accounts or contract code rather then the storage operations of the underlying data structure (e.g. a [Trie](../trie/)).

The library includes a TypeScript interface `StateManager` to ensure a unified interface (e.g. when passed to the VM) as well as a concrete Trie-based implementation `DefaultStateManager`.

### Example

```typescript
import { Account, Address } from '@ethereumjs/util'
import { DefaultStateManager } from '@ethereumjs/statemanager'

const stateManager = new DefaultStateManager()
const address = new Address(Buffer.from('a94f5374fce5edbc8e2a8697c15331677e6ebf0b', 'hex'))
const account = new Account(BigInt(0), BigInt(1000))
await stateManager.checkpoint()
await stateManager.putAccount(address, account)
await stateManager.commit()
await stateManager.flush()
```

## API

### Docs

Generated TypeDoc API [Documentation](./docs/README.md)

### BigInt Support

Starting with v1 the usage of [BN.js](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/) for big numbers has been removed from the library and replaced with the usage of the native JS [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) data type (introduced in `ES2020`).

Please note that number-related API signatures have changed along with this version update and the minimal build target has been updated to `ES2020`.

## Development

Developer documentation - currently mainly with information on testing and debugging - can be found [here](./DEVELOPER.md).

## EthereumJS
